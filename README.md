# Dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files and scripts, written primarily for use
on an Arch Linux system. My dotfiles are installed and managed by
[chezmoi][chezmoi].

To declutter `$HOME`, I make an effort to ensure that the programs I use adhere
to the [XDG Base Directory][xdg] specification as much as possible.

## Programs

If you are interested, some core programs I use are:

* Shell: fish (`exec`'d by bash)
* Window Manager: KWin
* Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma
* Terminal Emulator: Ghostty
* Browser: Firefox
* Password Manager: KeePass XC
* Music Player: Elisa
* Video Player: mpv
* Editor: Neovim, Emacs, and Visual Studio Code
