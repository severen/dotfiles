# Dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files and scripts, written primarily for use
on an Arch Linux system and installed and managed with [chezmoi][chezmoi].

As I value a clean `$HOME`, I make an effort to ensure that the programs I use
adhere to the [XDG Base Directory][xdg] specification as much as possible. And
for fun, I also try to ensure that all programs switch between light mode and
dark mode in accordance with the current system preference.

## Software

The core programs I use on a daily basis are:

* Desktop Environment: [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)
* Browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)
* Terminal Emulator: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
* Shell: [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
* Editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
* Version Control System: [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj)

None of the above are chosen randomly; they all make a positive impact on my
life and you should check them out!
